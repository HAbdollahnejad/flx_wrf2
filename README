FLX_WRF - root of tar file
          + contains flexpart-wrf.phase?.pdf (3 files - these
          + are documents from Jerome Fast, developer of FLXPART-WRF)

src_gfortran2 - contains source code of flexpart-wrf
                + some modifications were made so that it runs with
                + gfortran
                + modify Registry file of WRF source code and recompile
                + if necessary to output the following variables in
                + the wrfout_* files
                  ++ ALT, TKE, TKE_PBL, RAINC, RAINNC, CLDFRA
                + the code currently does not compute wetdeposition
                + i will modify it soon to try get the wetdeposition working
                + the makefile is tailored for gfortran

SCEN1 - a directory showing sample invocation of FLXPART-WRF
      - also contains ruby scripts that can help construct the
      - the various files needed to run FLEXPART

SCEN1/plot - contains Ruby and C code to convert FLXPART output
           - to C binary
           - use parse_header.rb followed by "cat dims.check" to
           - determine NX, NY and NZ parameters defined in flexpart_helpers.h
           - make_inlist.rb creates input_list, an ascii file containing
             + names of input files that multi_r*_w.c files need to
             + to create a single C binary file containing concentration,
             + wet deposition or dry deposition output
           - make_inlist.rb also creates time_list that is needed
             + by plot/ncl/plot_conc.ncl

SCEN1      - run_flx.rb
             + Once all parameters are set, I use run_flx.rb
             + to help make production runs

SCEN1/plot/ncl - NCL scripts that I use to make plots
